[My Notes](notes.md)

My Bookshelf is a website where users can enter books they read, and the books will be displayed on a bookshelf.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

### Elevator pitch

My Bookshelf allows users to track the books they read by putting them on a beautiful bookshelf! They can customize the appearance and placement of the books. Readers can rate and write reviews for each book, then share their ratings with other readers.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Five HTML pages, shown in the Design section of this README.
- **CSS** - Application styling that uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast. Creates the appearance of the bookshelf.
- **React** - Provides login, allows interactive moving books, and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Call to a third party for a book quote. Backend service with endpoints for:
    - login
    - retrieving books, ratings, and reviews
    - submitting books, ratings, and reviews
- **DB/Login** - Store users, book info, ratings, and reviews. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't add or move books unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As each user adds books, the title and rating are given to all other users.
